This is a project for the Fundamental AI course at KU Leuven.

The goal of this project is to implement Artificial Intelligence search algorithms for Pac-Man to control its path using Python code within a well-structured Pac-Man game.

The files I modified for the tasks are [search.py](https://github.com/tychu/Pac-Man/blob/main/search/search.py) and [searchAgents.py](https://github.com/tychu/Pac-Man/blob/main/search/searchAgents.py). The specific functions that need to be modified within those files depend on the task.

This document details a Berkeley AI project focusing on implementing various search algorithms within a Pac-Man game framework. **Students are tasked with creating depth-first search, breadth-first search, uniform-cost search, and A search algorithms in Python, testing them on different maze layouts and complexities.** The project further challenges students to **develop heuristics for more complex scenarios, such as finding all the corners of a maze or eating all the dots efficiently, emphasizing the importance of efficient search strategies and algorithm design**. Finally, students explore suboptimal search strategies as a means to quickly find solutions to difficult problems. The project is auto-graded, with specific instructions on submission guidelines and academic integrity.
